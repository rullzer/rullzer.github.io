      <description>Already back in October of 2016 probonopd made an AppImage for the Nextcloud Desktop Client. I must admit that back then I did not immediately try it out since I just run the client from source.
However, this has changed over the last few weeks as we wanted to start providing binary packages for Linux as well. When I was reading up on AppImage I got more excited. And since there already was a script to generate the AppImage I quickly built my very first AppImage.</description>
