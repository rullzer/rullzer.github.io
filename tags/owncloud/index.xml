      <description>I see a lot of people are setting up ownCloud these days that do not think about what it really means to do their own data management.
A lot of people have ownCloud running on a server somewhere and have the desktop sync client running on their laptop. They think their data is safe because if their laptop gets stolen or crashes the data is still on the server. Or that if the server crashes the data is still on the laptop.</description>
