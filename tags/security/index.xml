      <description>A Content Security Policy (CSP) can be used to protect against Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is done by having the server tell the browser what resources (executable script, images, etc) can be loaded from where. All this is told to the browser via a header, so if the actual page tries to do something it is not allowed the browser will block it.
At Nextcloud we have deployed a CSP for a while now that limited the resources to be loaded mainly to the domain your Nextcloud is running on.</description>
